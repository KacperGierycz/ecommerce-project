# ecommerce-project

This is so far the greatest and most complex creation I made with help of Chad Derby. 

Full stack Angular fromntend, BootStrap HTM CSS, Java Backend, SpringBOOT,SpringData , MySQL Database, OKTA security

I made a mind map of modules that are involve in a project this is mine way of learning and making notes this is a usefull way to wiev the project dependencies making it interactive (be FreeMind.app) takes a lot of time but is v usefull to modificate during a development stage. 
Screenshots of application working locally after maps.
